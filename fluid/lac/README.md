This model is based on the Baidu's LAC model (https://github.com/baidu/lac).

The Baidu's repo is included as a git submodule at `baidu/lac` subdirectory. However, instead of the `master` branch, the one which allows to limit the number of iteration during training is taken (https://github.com/wojtuss/lac/tree/wojtuss/lac-iterations).
